    "# Reasoning in AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning in AI refers to the process of using logical inference and deduction to draw conclusions and make informed decisions based on existing knowledge and relationships between facts. It involves applying rules and relations to derive new information from available data. The different types of reasoning in AI are *deductive*, *inductive*, *common sense*, *monotonic* and *non-monotonic* reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal: Logical deductions and conclusions from knowledge base/data.\n",
    "- Quality Criteria: Depends on accuracy, completeness, availability of relevant facts, logical rules, relationships, soundness, and consistency.\n",
    "- Success Criteria: Measured by correct answers, problem-solving, and accurate decisions from data and rules."

    "* Non-Monotonic Reasoning: Allows for revisions of conclusions based on new information. E.g., if it's cloudy, expect rain, but if there is a high-pressure system, revise the conclusion that it won't rain."
